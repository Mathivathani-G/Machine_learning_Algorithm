Artificial intelligence is the science of training machines to perform human tasks, whereas machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that instructs a machine how to learn.
Without machine learning, you have no AI. The ML process incorporates various machine learning algorithms that allow a system to identify patterns and make decisions without human involvement.

STEPS INVOLVED IN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS :

![Step 1](https://github.com/Mathivathani-G/Machine_learning_Algorithm/assets/171793413/34f3d0f7-e203-4850-b509-fac6d36e0e37)

An ML Package is a folder with all the code and metadata needed to train and serve a machine learning model.
Here so far I’ve used the following packages:
* TensorFlow (deep learning with neural networks)
* scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms)
* Pandas(import pandas as pd)
* Numpy(import numpy as np)
* Matplotlib(pyplot as plot)
  
From the above packages we have used severals modules including 

* from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix ,ConfusionMatrixDisplay,accuracy_score,classification_report,recall_score,f1_score,precision_score
* from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
* from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
* from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay
* from sklearn.svm import SVC,SVR
* from sklearn.cluster import KMeans,KMedoids,AgglomerativeClustering,DBSCAN
* from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
* from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression,LogisticRegression
* 
1. DECISION TREE:
Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

2.SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE:
A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data by finding an optimal line or hyperplane that maximizes the distance between each class in an N-dimensional space.

3.CLUSTERING :
The goal of clustering is to find distinct groups or “clusters” within a data set. Using a machine language algorithm, the tool creates groups where items in a similar group will, in general, have similar characteristics to each other.
